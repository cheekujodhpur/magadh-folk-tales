<blockquote>
The story revolves around a king who, while visiting his in-laws with a Thakur, is tricked into disguising himself as the Thakur while the Thakur takes on his identity. The Thakur gives the king a challenging task to gather wood from the forest without tying it, leading the king to seek help from the deities Mahadev and Parvati. They grant him a magical boon that allows him to bind and release objects with a special phrase.

Using this boon, the king manipulates situations in his favor, even binding himself and his queen together. Eventually, through cleverness and the decree of the deities, he manages to reveal his true identity and reaffirm his status as king. The story concludes happily with the king remarrying and ruling joyfully. It illustrates themes of deception, divine intervention, and the clever use of power.

Once, a king went to his in-laws along with a Thakur, and when they reached the fields, the Thakur let his horse loose and began to gallop. The Thakur said, "If you give me your clothes, then the horse will be able to hold on!" The king gave his clothes to the Thakur. Thus, the Thakur mounted the horse and went to the king's in-laws wearing his clothes. In the guise of the Thakur, the king also reached the in-laws, and the Thakur became the king. Now, the king had to remain in the disguise of the Thakur.

One day, the Thakur told the king, "Go to the forest and bring wood without tying any burden!" The king went to the forest and gathered wood, but when he tried to lift it, he found it too heavy. Exhausted, he started to cry. At that time, Mahadev and Parvati were wandering around. Parvati took pity and asked Mahadev to grant the king a boon, saying, "By saying 'Mahadev's word binds,' anything can be bound, and by saying 'Mahadev's word releases,' anything can be released!" With this boon, the king arrived at the pile of wood and said, "Mahadev's word binds!" and all the wood was bound together. The king took the wood home and then said, "Mahadev's word releases!" and all the wood got separated.

The king, dressed as a newlywed, entered the marriage chamber and said, "Mahadev's word binds," causing both of them to remain bound together. To understand this situation, a priest was called, and as he was approaching, he encountered the king in the guise of a newlywed who said, "They are bound," and the priest got stuck there. Then, a lady was called to observe the situation. As she crossed the river, she lifted her saree, and upon saying, "Mahadev's word binds," the lifted saree got stuck. As soon as she arrived at the royal court and observed the situation, she declared that the newlywed is the true king, and the one going to the marriage chamber is merely a newlywed! The king's boon states that whatever he says is bound will be bound, and whatever he says is released will be released. Then the king repeatedly said "release," and the lady was released, while the newlywed and queen were bound together. The king then remarried and began to rule joyfully.
