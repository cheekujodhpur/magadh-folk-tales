<blockquote>
The story is about a shepherd who has a simple life with his wives and son, relying on their cow for sustenance. The wives enjoy making sweet dishes like kheer, while the husband feels neglected, jokingly lamenting his own food. One night, the wives decide to scare the husband with a prank involving a skull, pretending to be the goddess Chandu, threatening to eat him or his family. In a clever twist, the husband suggests that the goddess should instead fill their rice with husk. The next morning, he discovers that his suggestion led to a humorous outcome, as the prank turns out to be a successful trick on his part. The tale reflects themes of cleverness, trickery, and the dynamics of family life.

मेहररुआ धान कूट के एक कोठी में चाउर रखले हल, आउ दोसर में भूँसा भरले हल। सब चाउर के जब ऊ खीर बना के खा गेल तो मरदाना से पतिआयओला उपाय कैलक। से ऊ एक रात के अपन माथा पर खपड़ी रख लेलक, हाथ में एगो छड़ी ले लेलक आउ जा के मरदनवाँ भिरू कहे लगल कि ''कउन हे?'’ मरदनवा देख के बड़ी डेरायल । पूछलक कि ''अपने के ही?'’ ऊ बड़ी गोड़-हाथ परे लगल आउ घिघिआय लगल कि ''अपने देव ही कि पितर ही, घरे के ही कि बाहर के ही?'' तब खपड़ी ओढ़ले मेहररुआ कहलक कि ''हम न देव ही, न पितर ही, न घरे के ही, न बाहर के ही। हम देवी चंडुका ही। बोल, तोरा खइअऊ कि तोर मेहररुआ के, कि तोर बेटा के खइअऊ कि भर कोठी चाउर भूसा कर दिअऊ?'’

Once there was a shepherd. He had only one son, and the rest were his wives, and there was no one else. He also had a cow. The shepherd earned a lot and fed his wives and son. The wives were very fond of cooking, so when they made rice, they added a lot of milk to it and made kheer to eat. The husband gave them sattu and sweets and said, "I'll die or live after eating kheer made with milk. You're enjoying your sattu, salt, and sweets, aren't you?"

The wives pounded rice and kept the flour in one room and filled another room with husk. When they had eaten the rice made into kheer, he decided to play a trick on his husband. So one night, he put a skull on his head, took a stick in hand, and went to his husband, saying, "Who is it?" The husband was very frightened upon seeing him. He asked, "Is it you?" The shepherd made gestures and started to cry, asking, "Are you a god, an ancestor, from inside the house or outside?" Then, the one with the skull said, "I am neither a god nor an ancestor, neither from inside the house nor outside. I am the goddess Chandu. Tell me, should I eat you, your wife, or your son, or should I fill the whole room with rice husk?"

The shepherd thought that if he were to eat someone, no one would come, but he could earn rice again. So he said, "O goddess Chandu, why should we feed you? Just fill all our rice with husk." The shepherd replied, "May it happen like that." And then he vanished. The next morning, the husband told the shepherd to go and see the grain in the storeroom. The shepherd walked over to check the storeroom, started crying, but inside he was laughing a lot at his own trick.
