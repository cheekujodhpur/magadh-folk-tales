A long time ago, there was a man and his mother who were Ahir. One day, the son asked his mother whether he was married or not. The mother replied that his marriage had already happened when he was in her womb. The son then said that he would go to his in-laws' house. The mother said, "Then go, my son! The fresh bread is ready." The Ahir went to his in-laws' house. While going, he reached his in-laws' place at night. When the in-laws started feeding him, he saw a lamp and asked, "What is this?" The in-laws joked that it was a "big child of the goddess Bhagjogni."

After eating and when everyone had fallen asleep, he saw the lamp and thought he should hide it. He thought he would take it home. With that in mind, he tucked it away in the straw-thatched house. As he was hiding it, the lamp caught fire. All the villagers rushed to extinguish it. They started pouring water and performing other rituals, while the Ahir, confused, ran here and there. Seeing this, everyone asked, "What is this guy doing?" He replied, "I have kept the 'child of the goddess Bhagjogni' over there. I am looking for it. I hope it doesn't burn too!" Then everyone said, "We understand now that this fire started because of that." The fire was extinguished, and after one or two days, he stayed at his in-laws' house, before returning home after making arrangements for his wife.

On the road, it was extremely hot. As he walked, the Ahir glanced back and saw blood streaming from his wife's head. The sweat was oozing down to the ground. Realizing it was blood, he became anxious and thought, "What now? Her head is split open!" Just then, a man came by with an ox. The Ahir swapped his wife for the ox and urged it forward. After a while, the ox began to urinate. When he tried to stop it with wet mud, it wouldn't budge. He thought that it had split its belly. Now what if it survives? So, he swapped the ox for a goat.

After going a little further, the goat also began to urinate. He tried to stop it with mud, but it wouldn't stop either. He thought to himself, now this one won't survive either; its belly must be split too. At that moment, a woman selling a cucumber passed by. He asked her for a cucumber and traded the goat for it. The woman happily handed him two cucumbers, and he took the cucumber home.

When he got home, his mother asked him why he was back so soon. The Ahir told his mother everything that had happened from start to finish. Then the mother replied, "That's fine. There were no vegetables today. Hurry up and make something!" The mother peeled and sliced the cucumbers and put them on the stove to cook. She went to the well to fetch water. She told the son that if she was late, he should take it off the fire. Meanwhile, the Ahir watched the vegetables boiling and bubbling. He exclaimed, "Are you scolding me? Stop! " He picked up a ladle and hit the pot twice, just as the mother returned with water. He told her, "You came back with water, and the vegetables started to boil over, so I got annoyed and hit the pot twice." The mother replied, "Oh, son of Natiya, you should have let it cook. Now it's ready to eat!"
