<blockquote>
The story revolves around a gathering woman who received wheat flour from a landlord during a wedding event. When she struggled to grind her flour due to lack of sunlight, she prayed, and sunlight appeared, allowing her to complete her task. Consequently, her flour was collected by the landlord, who later visited her home but became frustrated when she wasn't there. 

After a series of events, including the landlord inadvertently fertilizing the ground with his urination, a vegetable grew in her yard, which she ate, leading to the birth of a boy. As he grew, the boy was curious about his father but faced rejection from peers while playing. When he learned from his mother about his origins, he went to the landlord's daughter to ask about his father. The landlord confirmed the boy was indeed his son.

The boy enjoyed some time with his father, but eventually, he tragically drowned while trying to cross a stream, leaving the gathering woman alone once more. The story touches on themes of kinship, social class, and unintended consequences of actions.

One day long ago, there was a gathering. It was the time when the landlord's son was getting married. During that time, wheat flour was being distributed from house to house. The landlord gave two baskets of wheat flour to the gathering and distributed one basket of flour to everyone for the grinding. Everyone ground their share of flour and handed it over. The gathering hadn't ground her flour yet because she hadn’t received any sunlight. Then everyone advised her to say, "Let my sunlight come, God! I'll give you something!" She spoke like this and the sunlight appeared. She ground the flour and handed it over to the landlord. The next day, the landlord visited her. Then the gathering said, "Come tomorrow; I haven't done the cleaning today." The next day, after cleaning the house, she approached another person, meanwhile, the landlord went to her house but didn’t find the gathering there. The landlord became annoyed and urinated in a corner. There then grew a lot of green, tender leaves.

The gathering asked someone from the village, "The vegetable is very good; should it be eaten raw or cooked?" Everyone replied, "It’s in your courtyard; you do as you like!" The poor gathering ended up cooking the vegetable and ate it. From that vegetable, she gave birth to a boy. The boy was very good. He would stand apart and look around. When he went to school, he just sat there.

One day, he saw the other boys playing gully-danda (a traditional game), so he went home and said, "Mother, give me a gully-danda too; I want to play!" His mother said, "No, dear, you're a tender child; if someone hits you, what will I do alone?" After the boy insisted, the mother gave him a gully-danda. When he played, he couldn’t keep up. Then all the other kids expelled him from their group. The poor boy went off crying. When he got home, he asked his mother where his father was. His mother replied, "Oh dear, how should I tell you about your father? I ate greens, and that’s how you were born. And then she added, “You should ask the landlord's daughter who your father is!"

The boy went to the royal court where the landlord's daughter had come to fetch water. He broke her pot and asked her about his father. Then the girl went to the king and told him everything. The king sent the girl to call the boy. When the boy reached, the landlord told him that the one he was looking for was indeed his father. The boy sat on his thigh. The man asked him, "Who are you?" The boy replied, "I am your son." The man took him to the market and treated him to sweets and toys and stayed with him. 

After some days, he went out to search for his mother, and on the way, he found the riverbank. While crossing a stream, the poor boy drowned. The gathering was left alone once again.
